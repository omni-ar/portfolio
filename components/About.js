          I'm a results-driven Computer Science undergraduate at VIT Vellore
          (Graduating May 2027), passionate about building scalable systems,
          solving real-world problems through intelligent software, and
          constantly pushing my limits.<br /> With a solid foundation in DSA, Web
          Development, and AI/ML, Iâ€™ve worked on multiple full-stack projects
          and am currently deep-diving into machine learning and system design
          to align with the demands of high-impact engineering roles.<br />
          I thrive in fast-paced environments and believe in learning by building.<br /><br />

          curiosity, and execution. ðŸ™‚</strong>
